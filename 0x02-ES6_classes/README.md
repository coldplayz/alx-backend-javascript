# Fun with JavaScript Classes

* 0-classroom.js: create a simple class - `ClassRoom` - with one public instance field.

* 1-make_classrooms.js: create `ClassRoom` objects.

* 2-hbtn_course.js: implement `HolbertonCourse` with getters and setters.

* 3-currency.js: implement `Currency` with getters and setters, and a method.

* 4-pricing.js: implement `Pricing` with getters, setters, instance, and static methods.

* 5-building.js: implemented `Building`, requiring subclasses to override a method.

* 6-sky_high.js: implemented `Building` subclass, overriding `.evacuationWarningMessage()`.

* 7-airport.js: implemented `Airport`, customizing the default string description of the class using Symbols.

* 8-hbtn_class.js: implemented `HolbertonClass`, with conversion to primitives using `Symbols`.

* 9-hoisting.js: debbuging exercise. Notes taken:
  * classes are not hoisted; declare/define them before trying to access;
  * named exports would need to be enclosed in parenthesis during imports.

* 10-car.js: implemented `Car`, and a cloning method that clones an object using `Object.assign()`.

* 100-evcar.js: implements `EVCar`, a subclass of Car that will not be cloned.
